- Hi, I am Govind (aka. Vio) 🧐 <br>
- I love to explore and work on new stuff a lot (Yes, I do have a bit too many sideprojects as a result but ... hey its all good practice in the end) 🕵️‍ <br>
- I am rn working on DSA and Flutter, planning on going deep into ML and stuff 👷‍ <br>

If you would like to help me with stuff or want me to help you out with something (\*cough collaboration \*cough), feel free to reach me on my [mail](b.s.dnivog@gmail.com) I'll get to you when Im free 🤙<br>
